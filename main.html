    <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity refers to the efficiency of an algorithm. It measures how the running time of an algorithm increases with the input size. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity, which means they can process large inputs quickly.</p>
    <p>Space Complexity, often denoted as <b>O(n)</b>, is a measure of the memory space used by an algorithm with respect to the input size. It indicates the maximum amount of memory an algorithm needs to execute, considering the worst-case scenario.</p>
